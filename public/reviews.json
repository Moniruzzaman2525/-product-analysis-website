Very attractive watch and having the option to switch the front face keep its new if you get bored of one. Interested to see how things change with Google Wear OS 3!"

The watch itself looks a bit better and smoother than the old Gen4. The inclusion of the speaker is very nice. But man, that smaller screen and the resulting thick black bezel around it... Ugh.  "
